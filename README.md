# How to Validate Regression Models

<p>With the prevalence of online courses in machine learning (ML) and the popularity of Python, there is no question as to the enthusiasm for ML. It’s no longer the dark magic reserved only for “quants” who lurked within the shadows of fintech companies pre-2008. ML is an exciting subject that promises a lot of predictive power and there are countless introductory online tutorials that make ML seem as easy as <code>model.fit(X)</code>.<p/>

<p>While amazing Python libraries, such as Scikit Learn and StatsModels, have abstracted the complexity of ML, it by no means excludes the aspiring data scientist from the burden of proving their trained ML models are a good fit for the data. Too many online tutorials do not address the vital topic of model validation. Determining model validity only by comparing the predictive accuracy on the validation data set is not enough. Deploying an invalid model to production can have disastrous results for an organization if decision makers heed faulty predictions.</p> 

<p>In this project, we will examine validation methods for regression models.</p>
